This project aims to develop a deep learning model able to detect a barcode in a given image. The model behind it is Tiny YOLO 3, which a light version of YOLO 3 with less hidden layers in the neural network architecture. This helps significantly reduce the inference time, although its predictive accuracy is lower than YOLO 3 itself. For real time applications, this trade-off can be accepted in most cases.
